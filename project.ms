// Research Question: "How does stress affect performance in the classroom?"
// Throughout this program I will mention Stress and Sleep a ton-
// -as they are directly related to my research question.
// Sleep tends to occur when the ATP receptors in your brain are
// activated (Dingman, 2022, p. 66)
// Memory is the brain's way of making and keeping associations
// between things that happen in our daily lives, sometimes they are
// only in the brain for a short time (short-term memory) or the rest
// of our lives (long-term memory) (Dingman, 2022, p. 30)
// Stress is being used because it directly effects memory encoding-
// memory consolidation, and memory retrieval. (Vogel et al. 2016, p. 3)
// Students are often stressed by exams, tests, and other in-
// classroom events which can lead to strong negative memories
// (Vogel et al. 2016, p. 4) which actually inspired me to start 
// my quest on this research project because I was always 
// interested in different ways students could learn and still be 
// tested but not have their mental health depleted by getting 
// poor scores.
// People induced by stress can find tasks increasingly harder
// than when not stressed or in some cases when pain is involved
// stress can actually amplify the pain
// (Schwabe et al. 2009, p. 4)

// There are different aspects that can affect memory consolidation when studying
// the environment, the length, and if there was stress before hand
// Stress before or during a learning episode can impact the initial encoding of the information
// and is closely linked to memory consolidation.
// (Vogel et al. 2016, p. 3)
pathways = json.parse(file.open("pathways.json").read).normalPathways
// Some pathways will have similar counterparts because
// "While stress around the time of learning enhances memory,
// stress (or cortisol administration of 25mg) long before learning
// or in a distinctly different context does not promote new learning
// and can even hinder successful encoding of new information"
// (Vogel et al. 2016, p. 3)
// This is also corroborated by "Stress effects on memory are time
// dependent, with stress before retention testing having mostly
// impairing effect" and that stress before retention testing specifically
// could actually enhance memory retrieval
// (Schwabe et al. 2009, p. 6)
// "Very often, students are not only required to recall study
// material, but to integrate new information into existing
// knowledge structures. In fact, integrating new information
// into existing memories is a key process in education."
// (Vogel et al. 2016, p. 4)
// This piece of information influenced the way I thought about
// creating this scenario because of the way it made me think about
// how people actually learn and recall information throughout the
// preparation of test studying.

// "Stressed subjects performed worse than nonstressed controls 
// when the learning and testing contexts were incongruent. 
// This is in line with previous reports of impaired memory 
// retrieval following stress" (Schwabe et al. 2009, p. 5)
// The results from this experiment definitively say that people
// who are stressed had a tougher time, this relates to my research
// and game because it replicates the results of the study in terms
// of the relationship between stress and memory
